# Waste-Segregation
#Problem Statement:#
Improper waste disposal contributes to environmental degradation, increased landfill waste and inefficient recycling processes. Manual sorting is labour-intensive, error-prone and costly. An AI-powered waste classification system addresses these challenges by streamlining waste segregation, reducing operational costs and improving recycling rates.

#Objectives:#
This project applies deep learning techniques to enhance recycling efficiency, reduce environmental pollution and promote sustainable waste management practices to achieve following objectives

Automated waste sorting, cutting time and labour
Increased recycling rated by precise classification of recyclables
